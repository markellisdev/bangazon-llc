## Serializing Data Frames as JSON

A Panda data frame has a [.to_json()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_json.html) method that will serialize the Python data structure into JSON format in order to send the data to a client. The client can then parse that JSON into a JavaScript object/array and use it however it likes.

## Possible Reports and Visualizations

For an eCommerce site like Bangazon, business development teammates and sales executives would love to see these kinds of reports.

1. Top revenue generating customer(s).
1. Total number of transactions per day, week, month, year.
1. Customers who purchased the most per quarter.
1. Lowest revenue generating customer(s). These would be people who sell the least number of items they post for sale.
1. Customers that haven't accessed the site in the last 3 months.
1. Most recommended product(s).
1. Most liked product(s).
